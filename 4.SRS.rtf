### Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for AI-Powered Faceless Video Generation Platform\
\
This section provides a comprehensive analysis and detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the AI-Powered Faceless Video Generation Platform, focusing on the technical aspects for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The analysis leverages the provided context, including the Upwork Project Description, Job Analysis, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Automated Viral Video Creation SOP, and Product Requirements Document (PRD), to ensure alignment with project requirements and existing workflows.\
\
#### Context and Background\
The project, as outlined in the Upwork Project Description, involves developing a web application similar to AutoShorts.ai, automating the creation, customization, and scheduling of short-form faceless videos for platforms like TikTok and YouTube Shorts. Key features include user authentication, AI-driven video generation, customization options, scheduling, multi-language support, and an analytics dashboard. Technical requirements specify using React.js or Vue.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express or Python with Django/Flask for the backend, MongoDB or PostgreSQL for the database, and integrations with AI APIs like OpenAI and ElevenLabs, alongside video processing tools like FFmpeg.\
