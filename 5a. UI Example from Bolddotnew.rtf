\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Viral Video App UI\
\
I've created a modern, professional landing page that includes all the requested features:\
\
A compelling hero section with the main headline and subheadline\
A clean, user-friendly form for video idea submission and email collection\
A "How it Works" section with three clear steps\
Platform compatibility information\
A footer with a privacy policy link\
Success message after form submission\
The design features:\
\
A beautiful purple gradient background\
Modern card-based layout with shadow effects\
Responsive design that works on all screen sizes\
Clear visual hierarchy with icons and typography\
Smooth form handling with loading and success states\
Lucide icons for visual elements\
The form is fully functional and includes:\
\
Form validation for required fields and email format\
Loading state during submission\
Success message after submission\
Clear helper text and placeholders\
Proper accessibility attributes\
Note: The form submission is currently simulated with a timeout. You'll need to connect it to your backend API that handles the Telegram bot integration and email notifications.\
