Viral Video Landing Page
Here's a description of the landing page your AI coding assistant can use to generate it:
Page Title: Turn Your Ideas into Viral Videos - Automatically!
Headline: Stop Wasting Time on Manual Video Creation. Describe Your Video Idea and Let AI Do the Rest!
Subheadline: Get faceless short-form videos generated, ready for platforms like Instagram Reels, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts, without lifting a finger after submitting your idea.
Sections:
1. Video Idea Submission Form:

   * Label: Describe your video idea:
   * Input Type: Large text area (<textarea>)
   * Placeholder: E.g., "A golden retriever puppy playing fetch in a sunny park."
   * Helper Text (Optional): "Be as specific as possible with your description. You can also include desired camera angles or any text you'd like to see on the video." (Based on how the Telegram bot currently takes input.)
   2. Email Address Collection:

      * Label: Your Email Address:
      * Input Type: Email (<input type="email">)
      * Placeholder: E.g., "yourname@email.com"
      * Helper Text: "We'll email you a link to your completed video."
      3. Submit Button:

         * Text: Generate My Video!
         * Type: Submit (<button type="submit">)
         4. How it Works (Brief Explanation):

            * Headline: Simple 3-Step Video Creation
            * Steps:
            * Step 1: Describe Your Video: Tell us your video idea in the form above.
            * Step 2: Automated AI Generation: Our AI agent will take your idea, generate the video with voiceover and subtitles, optimized for viral short-form content. This process is similar to the automated system described where a Telegram message initiates the creation.
            * Step 3: Get Notified: Once your video is ready, we'll send a download link to your email address. (This part is new compared to the source which uses Telegram for final notification.)
            5. Optional Elements (Below the Fold):

               * Briefly mention the platforms the videos are suitable for (Instagram Reels, TikTok, YouTube Shorts).
               * A link to a privacy policy explaining how their email will be used.
               * Potentially, a few examples of videos generated by the system (if available).
Functionality for your AI Coding Assistant:
               * Form Submission: When the user clicks "Generate My Video!", the data from the "Describe your video idea" text area and the "Your Email Address" input field needs to be collected.
               * Sending to Telegram: The video idea (and optionally, any specified camera angles or on-screen text if you decide to keep that in the single prompt field) needs to be sent as a message to your pre-configured Telegram bot. This mirrors the initial trigger of the automated workflow described in the source. Your coding will need to integrate with the Telegram Bot API to send this message.
               * Email Collection and Association: The submitted email address needs to be stored and associated with the video generation request initiated by the Telegram message. This could involve using a database or another method to link the user's email with the ongoing process.
               * Completion Notification via Email: Once the automated video creation process (which currently ends with a Telegram notification) is complete, a system needs to be in place to:
               * Retrieve the generated video's link.
               * Identify the user's email address associated with the initial request.
               * Send an email to the user containing the link to download or view their completed video. This will require integrating with an email sending service or using an SMTP server.
Important Considerations (for you):
               * You'll need to modify the existing n8n workflow (or similar automation) to, upon completion of the video generation and saving to Google Sheets, also trigger an email notification to the user based on the email collected on the landing page. This will likely involve adding a new node in your n8n workflow that interacts with an email service (like Gmail, SendGrid, etc.).
               * You'll need a way to securely store the email addresses collected and associate them with the video generation requests.
               * Consider adding error handling and user feedback to the landing page (e.g., confirmation message after submission, indication of processing time).
This description provides a foundation for your AI coding assistant to generate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for your landing page. Remember that the backend logic to connect the landing page to your Telegram bot and to send the completion email will require further development on your part.
