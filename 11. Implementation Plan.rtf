### Implementation Plan for AI-Powered Faceless Video Generation Platform\
\
This section provides a comprehensive analysis and detailed implementation plan for developing the AI-Powered Faceless Video Generation Platform, tailored to the user's constraints of no coding skills, a $0 budget, and team support. The plan leverages the tech stack identified in previous discussions, prioritizing free or free-tiered tools while ensuring all key features are covered, as of 07:00 AM PDT on Sunday, April 13, 2025.\
\
#### Context and Background\
The Upwork Project Description outlines developing a web application similar to AutoShorts.ai, automating faceless short-form video creation (30-90 seconds) for TikTok and YouTube Shorts, with features like user authentication, AI-driven generation, customization, scheduling, multi-language support, and analytics. Technical requirements include React.js/Vue.js for frontend and Node.js/Express for backend, but given the user's skills, the project shifted to no-code tools. The Job Analysis confirmed feasibility with team support, leveraging the Automated Viral Video Creation SOP, which details a 19-step workflow using n8n, OpenAI, Cling AI, and social media tools like Zapier and Buffer. The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Product Requirements Document (PRD), Software Requirements Specification (SRS), Features Results, App Flow Document, Frontend Guidelines, Backend Structure, and Tech Stack Document provided detailed insights into the project's scope and implementation.\
\
Given the user's constraints, research into no-code platforms suggested Bubble.io for web app development, RunwayML for video generation, and Zapier for social media integration, ensuring feasibility. The tech stack includes Bubble.io for full-stack no-code, RunwayML via Bubble plugin for AI, Zapier for social media, Cloudinary for media storage (free tier), and Bubble.io's built-in database. The implementation plan focuses on maximizing free tiers to stay within the $0 budget, with plans for client clarification on production costs.\
