### Detailed Analysis and Report Note\
\
This section provides a comprehensive analysis and detailed backend structure for the AI-Powered Faceless Video Generation Platform, focusing on the technical implementation for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The analysis leverages the provided Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Software Requirements Specification (SRS), ensuring alignment with project requirements and existing workflows, given the current time is 06:32 AM PDT on Sunday, April 13, 2025.\
\
#### Context and Background\
The project, as outlined in the PRD and SRS, involves developing a web application that automates the creation of short-form faceless videos (30-90 seconds) for social media platforms like TikTok and YouTube Shorts. Key features include user authentication, AI-driven video generation, customization options, scheduling, multi-language support, and an analytics dashboard. The backend must support these features with RESTful APIs, integrate with third-party AI services (e.g., OpenAI, ElevenLabs), and handle video processing using tools like FFmpeg. The SRS specifies functional requirements like secure login, video generation, and analytics, alongside non-functional requirements for performance (e.g., handling 100 concurrent users) and security (e.g., HTTPS, JWT authentication).\
\
The PRD provided detailed user stories, flows, and technical architecture, which are adapted into this backend structure. The SRS further clarified the technology stack, including backend frameworks (Node.js with Express or Python with Django/Flask) and database options (MongoDB or PostgreSQL), ensuring a technically robust implementation. Given the team's existing capabilities from the Automated Viral Video Creation SOP, which details automation with n8n and API integrations, the backend structure leverages these strengths while focusing on scalability and performance.\

\
### 3. API Design\
\
#### 3.1 RESTful API Endpoints\
The backend will expose RESTful APIs for the frontend to interact with, following standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Key endpoints include:\
\
| **Endpoint**                | **Method** | **Purpose**                                      | **Request/Response Example**                     |\

\
#### 3.2 API Authentication\
- Use JWT for authentication, with tokens generated upon login and validated for each protected endpoint.\
- Store tokens in HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks, with secure and HttpOnly flags set.\
- Implement rate limiting using middleware (e.g., express-rate-limit for Node.js) to prevent abuse, with a limit of 100 requests per minute per user.\
\
#### 3.3 Error Handling\
- Return standard HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 500 Internal Server Error).\
- Include error messages in the response body, such as `\{error: "Invalid email format"\}`, for client-side handling.\
- Log errors to a centralized logging system (e.g., Loggly, New Relic) for monitoring and debugging.\
\
### 4. Data Management\
\
#### 4.1 Database Schema\
The database will store key entities, with the following schema (using MongoDB as an example for flexible schema):\
\
- **User**:\
  - id: ObjectId\
  - email: String (unique, required)\
  - password: String (hashed with bcrypt)\
  - name: String\
  - preferences: JSON (e.g., default language, voice profile)\
  - createdAt: Date\
  - updatedAt: Date\
\
- **VideoProject**:\
  - id: ObjectId\
  - userId: ObjectId (references User)\
  - title: String\
  - prompt: String\
  - language: String\
  - voiceProfile: String\

- Implement secure session management, with tokens expiring after a set period (e.g., 24 hours).\
\
### 7. Performance Requirements\
\
#### 7.1 Load Handling\
- Handle at least 100 concurrent users, with load balancing using tools like Nginx or cloud load balancers (e.g., AWS ELB).\
- Use caching with Redis for frequently accessed data, such as user profiles and video metadata, reducing database load.\
\
#### 7.2 Response Times\
- Ensure API response times are under 2 seconds, optimized with caching and efficient database queries.\
