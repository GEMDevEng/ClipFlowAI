- **UX/UI Designer**: Design user interfaces and user experience flows

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Chakra UI, FFmpeg.js, Web Speech API
- **Backend**: Supabase (Authentication, Database, Storage)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

1. **Browser Compatibility**
   - **Risk**: Some browsers may not support all required APIs
   - **Mitigation**: Implement feature detection and fallbacks

2. **Performance Limitations**
   - **Risk**: Client-side video processing may be slow on some devices
   - **Mitigation**: Optimize processing, add progress indicators, implement quality settings

3. **API Rate Limits**
   - **Risk**: Social media platforms may impose rate limits
   - **Mitigation**: Implement queuing and rate limiting in the application

4. **Storage Costs**
   - **Risk**: Exceeding free tier limits on Supabase
   - **Mitigation**: Implement video compression, cleanup old videos, monitor usage

5. **Feature Creep**
   - **Risk**: Scope expansion delaying launch
   - **Mitigation**: Strict prioritization, MVP focus, defer non-essential features

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Users can create videos with AI-generated content
2. Videos can be shared to multiple social media platforms
3. The application runs entirely in the browser
4. The system operates within the free tier limits of all services
5. Users can manage their videos and track performance

## Post-Launch Plan

After the initial launch, the focus will shift to:

1. **User Feedback Collection**: Gather and analyze user feedback
2. **Feature Enhancements**: Implement most requested features
3. **Performance Optimization**: Continue improving performance
4. **Platform Expansion**: Add support for additional social media platforms
5. **Community Building**: Foster a community of content creators

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to developing ClipFlowAI. By following this plan, we aim to create a high-quality application that meets user needs while staying within our $0 budget constraint. Regular reviews of progress against this plan will help ensure we stay on track and deliver a successful product.
