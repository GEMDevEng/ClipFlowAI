# Analytics Feature

## Current Implementation

The Analytics feature provides a basic dashboard for users to view performance metrics for their videos. The current implementation includes:

1. A summary view showing:
   - Total number of videos
   - Total views across all videos
   - Total likes across all videos
   - Total shares across all videos

2. Placeholder sections for:
   - Views over time chart
   - Performance by platform chart
   - Insights and recommendations

## Data Source

Currently, the analytics data is sourced from the `videos` table in Supabase, which contains basic metrics (views, likes, shares) for each video. The implementation aggregates this data to show overall statistics.

## Future Enhancements

The following enhancements are planned for future releases:

1. **Dedicated Analytics Table**: A separate `analytics` table will be created to store more detailed metrics over time. The SQL migration file for this table is available at `src/supabase/migrations/create_analytics_table.sql`.

2. **Charts Implementation**: Replace the placeholder charts with actual data visualization using a library like Chart.js or Recharts.

3. **Platform-specific Analytics**: Track and display metrics specific to each platform (TikTok, YouTube, etc.).

4. **Time-based Analysis**: Allow users to filter analytics by time periods (day, week, month, custom range).

5. **Automated Data Collection**: Implement a background process to periodically fetch updated metrics from social media platforms.

6. **Insights Engine**: Develop an algorithm to generate meaningful insights and recommendations based on the analytics data.

## Integration with Notification System

In future releases, the Analytics feature will be integrated with the Notification system to:

1. Alert users when videos reach certain performance milestones
2. Provide weekly/monthly performance reports
3. Notify users of unusual activity (viral spikes, engagement drops)

## Testing

The current implementation includes basic unit tests for the Analytics component. Future releases will add more comprehensive tests for:

1. Data fetching and aggregation
2. Chart rendering
3. Filtering and time-based analysis
4. Integration with the notification system
